## Branch integration rules (jaex → develop)

For the process of integrating features from the `jaex` branch into `develop`, strictly follow the workflow defined in:
`.agent/workflows/import_jaex_features.md`

This workflow covers:
- Comparison and identification of features.
- Branch safety and isolation.
- Mandatory verification steps (including UI and Image Effects protection).
- Pull Request requirements.
